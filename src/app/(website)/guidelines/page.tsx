These are the official posting guidelines ("Site Guidelines") for www.ratemyhst.com website, application or other interactive service ("Site"). The Site is owned, operated and/or provided by RateMyHST, LLC ("RateMyHST," "we," "us," or "our") and these Site Guidelines are a part of, and Additional Terms under, our Terms of Use Agreement.

RateMyHST is the largest online destination for students to research and rate teachers, schools, and districts across the United States. Our mission is to provide a safe forum to share classroom experiences to help fellow students make critical education choices.

THE SITE/APP

The RateMyHST website (www.ratemyhst.com) and mobile app provide user generated feedback on teachers' teaching methods and their respective courses as well as user generated feedback on the lifestyle and facilities of school and district campuses.

Teacher ratings should only be posted by users who have taken a class from the teacher or who are currently taking a class with the teacher. For each course a teacher teaches, users are limited to posting one (1) comment. School ratings should only be posted by students who have attended or are currently attending the specific course, school or district being rated.

RateMyHST is NOT the place to report dangerous, illegal or illicit behaviors. If you believe that you, another teacher, or a student is in danger, we strongly advise you to report such incidences directly to your campus authorities or local law enforcement. (For more information and resources, please read here).

HOW WE WORK

RateMyHST has a team of moderators who read every rating submitted. We have defined site guidelines to help reinforce our mission and most importantly to ensure our decisions around moderation are 100% consistent, regardless of student or teacher. Our moderators are experts on our guidelines and will remove any comment that doesn't comply.

Did we miss something? If you feel an inappropriate comment should be removed from the site, we want to know. You can flag a comment for re-review and it will immediately be escalated to our moderators. Moderators will determine whether to remove the rating permanently or restore it to the website. Our moderators will never edit a rating to make it comply or remove a rating simply because it is a low score or negative review.

GUIDELINES:

Student Guidelines:

    Be honest in your reviews. You want to be able to trust these reviews when evaluating your course options so we ask that you contribute in the same spirit.
    When you are reviewing a class and/or teacher, it's often helpful to provide both pros and cons. This leads to much more credible and constructive feedback for your peers.
    Reviews should focus specifically on the course and your learning experience. Do not comment on a teacher's appearance, dress, age, gender or race.
    Avoid hearsay. We want you to share your individual experience and what you took away from the course. Don't speak on behalf of another; encourage others to submit their own reviews.
    This is not a forum for debate. Reviews that specifically reference another review will be removed. If you do not agree with someone's individual experience, we encourage you to share your own.
    We understand that not all teachers are the perfect match for each individual learning style. Tell us how the course or teacher wasn't the best for you in a way that helps others make their own decision.
    Reviews fueled by anger do not reflect well on the author and can be removed for violations such as profanity. Take a minute to step back and make sure your review will genuinely help others understand your experience.
    RateMyHST reserves the right to remove ratings that do not contain substantive comments.
    We only allow one student to review a teacher one time per course. Spamming or dogpiling an account will lead to comment removal and the account being temporarily locked on the site.
    When reading your fellow students' reviews, we encourage you to use your discretion and weigh every review amongst the others. Online reviews should be one of the many resources used when making a decision that affects your academic future.

Prohibited Content: Comments that contain the following will be removed:

    Profanity, name-calling, and/or vulgarity, derogatory remarks about religion, ethnicity or race, gender, physical appearance, age, mental and/or physical disabilities;
    Identifiable information about a teacher or student that would allow someone to contact the teacher/student outside of their school;
    References to a teacher's or student's family, personal life and/or sex life, including sexual innuendos;
    Claims that a teacher shows bias for or against a student or specific group of students (For more information and resources, please read here);
    Claims about a teacher's employment status, including previous employment;
    Claims that a teacher or student engages or has engaged in illegal activities;
    Direct references to other existing comments or comments that have been deleted by our moderators;
    Accusations that the teacher is rating themselves or their colleagues;
    A language other than English. Comments must be written in English only. French is allowed if you attend a French-Canadian school;
    Hyperlinks and/or URLs.

Teacher Guidelines:

    This is an anonymous website where students can share their classroom experiences. We are unable to provide any data or personal information about the submitter of a review.
    We do not proactively add any teacher, course or campus to our website, every profile was submitted by our student community.
    We are unable to remove a comment simply because it is negative. It will only be removed if it doesn't comply with our site guidelines.
    We encourage you to engage with students on the site by creating a RateMyHST account. With a teacher account, you have the ability to post a reply and get alerted when new ratings are posted on your profile. To create your teacher account, get started here.
    Replies fueled by anger do not reflect well on the author and can be removed for violations such as profanity. Take a minute to step back and make sure your reply will genuinely help others.
    RateMyHST's moderation team is unable to prove or disprove details mentioned in a review. We are not arbiters of facts. If you disagree with the details mentioned in a review, see paragraph above regarding managing your profile.
    If you believe that your profile is being spammed or dogpiled, please tell us. You can contact us at support@ratemyhst.com. We're here to help and will happily review the comments in question.
    While it is against our guidelines for a teacher to rate themselves, we recommend for teachers to encourage their students to provide ratings each semester. The more reviews you have, the more representative they will be.
    Teacher replies are subject to the same limitations regarding Prohibited Content, as set forth above.

FLAGGING A RATING

If you see a rating that you believe violates these Site Guidelines, please click the "report this rating" at the bottom of the comment and state the problem. Such comments will be evaluated by the Site's personnel. Please do not flag a rating just because you disagree with it.

SOME LEGAL STUFF

RateMyHST occasionally receives removal demands that include threats to sue RateMyHST. To date, no one has followed through with a lawsuit against us for our reviews.

The law protects RateMyHST from legal responsibility for the content submitted by our users, like the reviews that appear on our site. Specifically, the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (47 U.S.C. Sec. 230) created a federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers, like RateMyHST, liable for information originating with a third-party user of the service.

The law is clear on this. Anyone who wishes to sue RateMyHST for the reviews posted by our members risks penalties imposed by the court. These may include financial sanctions and reimbursement of our attorney's fees for our having to defend against a lawsuit that ignores obvious legal protections for RateMyHST.

If, despite our caution, you feel that legal action is the only recourse for you, our address for service of legal process is:

RateMyHST, LLC
50 Broad Street
20th Floor
New York, NY 10004

If you intend to serve documents on RateMyHST, LLC, please make sure that service is properly effected in the U.S. in accordance with all applicable law. We are not obligated to respond if service is not valid.

These guidelines are provided for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice. While we stand by our guidelines, you are encouraged to seek advice from an attorney who is competent in the relevant field of law.
