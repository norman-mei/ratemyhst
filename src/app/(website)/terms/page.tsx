This Site is designed and targeted to audiences residing in, and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of, the United States of America, its territories and possessions ("U.S."). You must be at least 17 years of age or older ("Site Minimum Age") and reside in or attend, have attended or teach at a university in the U.S., United Kingdom or Canada (the "Site School Requirements") to use this Site, but certain features on this Site may be subject to heightened age and/or other eligibility requirements. For example, if this Site requires you to be at least 17 years of age, please be aware that certain areas on the Site may contain content for which you must be greater than the Site Minimum Age to access and view even if this Site's age eligibility requirements are less than the Site Minimum Age. If you are not yet the Site Minimum Age or the required greater age for certain features, do not meet the Site School Requirements and/or do not meet any other eligibility requirements, or, if for any reason, you do not agree with all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, please discontinue using the Site immediately because by using or attempting to use the Site, you certify that you are at least the Site Minimum Age or other required greater age for certain features, meet the Site School Requirements, meet any other eligibility and residency requirements of the Site and agree to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

These terms and conditions regarding your use of the Site constitute a legally binding agreement between you, on the one hand, and RateMyHST, on the other hand.

In this Agreement, the term "Site" includes all websites and web pages within or associated with the Site (such as third level domain names and other subdomains) as well as any equivalent, mirror, replacement, substitute or backup websites and web pages that are associated with the Site. By using this Site, you understand, acknowledge and agree that you will abide by the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms that govern certain products and/or services which will be presented in conjunction with those products and/or services ("Additional Terms"), including, but not limited to, any terms that may be provided on the Site relating to the submission of content, media and materials you submit for posting on the Site ("User Content Submission Agreement"), the rules of participation ("Rules") which govern certain activities and services such as voting (for example, see the Voting Rules as described below) and contests and sweepstakes and the Site Guidelines. The Site's Additional Terms and the Privacy Policy are hereby incorporated in this Agreement by reference. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and Additional Terms for the activity which you choose to participate in, the Additional Terms shall govern. This Agreement will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site and, in the event of termination of any membership, service or feature, you will still be bound by your obligations under this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms), such as any indemnifications, warranties and limitations of liability.

The words "use" or "using" in this Agreement means any time an individual (a "user"), directly or indirectly, with or without the aid of a machine or device, does or attempts to access, interact with use, display, view, print or copy from the Site, transmit, receive or exchange data or communicate with the Site, or in any way utilizes, benefits, takes advantage of or interacts with any function, service or feature of the Site, for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement does not cover your rights or responsibilities with respect to third party content or sites or any links that may direct your browser or your connection to third party sites or pages.
